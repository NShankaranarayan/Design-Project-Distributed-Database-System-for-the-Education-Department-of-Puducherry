# Design-Project-Distributed-Database-System-for-the-Education-Department-of-Puducherry

Gained practical experience in designing a distributed database system.
Following are the tasks performed:
1. Captured the necessary requirements and prepared a detailed Problem description
2. Wrote relevant sample queries.
3. Modeled the requirement using the EER conceptual model.
4. produced a detailed database schema from the EER model.
5. Based on the compiled requirement, derived a set of data dependencies (FD) and data constraints
6. Used FDs to normalize the original database schema into BCNF
7. Performed primary and derived horizontal and vertical fragmentation and data allocation using BEA algorithm
8. Proposed a set of indexes, based on the final schema that improve query run time
9. Analysed each proposed index by identifying which queries benefit from these indexes.
10. Reviewed the constructed system and suggested ways to improve it.
